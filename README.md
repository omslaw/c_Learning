This is where my code from the cs106b Stanford class will reside. 

The book being used is call Programming Abstractions. I'm currently following the 2014 Spring course and the materials and projects will be from there. 

That is why I have to use QT Creator. Here are the instructions I used to push changes. 

Basically just ignore that git stuff in QT Creator. Only thing I could do is just do commits from it. I can either run the Git GUI and just sync the repos there or use the command line. 

To do it from the Git Shell. (https://help.github.com/articles/create-a-repo)

-git add XXXXX  ( to add the filenames)
-git commit -m 'XXXXX'  (from the above link)
-git commit -a -m 'XXXX' (how i do it from work, not sure of the diff)
-git push  or git push origin master. Both seemed to work for me. 


To clone a repo down to my machine:
-git clone XXXXXXX
